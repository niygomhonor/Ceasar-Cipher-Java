# Ceasar-Cipher-java
This project will allow users to encrypt and decrypt their messages

## Behavior Driven Development
  
  * User must enter a word with different alphabet not a symbol
  * User must enter a key or shift  as integer number
    + _Actually alphabet are 26, shift would be between 1-25 apart from that there is condition to allow user to type 
    any number even greater than 26._
 * `If statement`  
 - [x]  When user enter a number greater than 0, condition will return key or shift considering the `Remainder` after
  `divide` that `number` by `26`  
 - [x]  When user enter a number less than 0, condition will return key or shift considering the `Remainder` after 
 `divide` that `number` by `26` plus(+) number of alphabet `26` 
    + the use of this is to maintain interval of `1- 25`  shift and let symbols stay in its normal state.
  + `Loop(For)`
  
-[x]  After changing entered word into characters `loop` will count by adding characters together to make meaningful word.
